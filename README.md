DSLEC Game is a web-based educational application designed to help children with dyslexia improve their reading, word recognition, color-word association, and handwriting skills through interactive and engaging games.

## Screenshots

To add screenshots:
1. Run the development server with `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
2. Take screenshots of key features (e.g., login, dashboard, each game level, reading helper).
3. Create a `screenshots` folder in the project root (or `public/screenshots` for static serving).
4. Add the image files (e.g., PNG or JPG) to the folder.
5. Reference them in this README using Markdown: `![Alt text](screenshots/filename.png)`.
6. Commit and push the changes: `git add . && git commit -m "Add screenshots to README" && git push`.
